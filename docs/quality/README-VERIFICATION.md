## README Verification — Lecture 14

Performed on this checkout, following README.md exactly, step by step,
with no undocumented prior knowledge assumed:

- [x] `git clone` + steps in "Getting Started" produce a running server
- [x] `git clone` + steps in "Getting Started" produce a running client
- [x] Every environment variable the app actually requires is documented
- [x] Every command shown in the README actually runs without modification

Result: 1 gap found — larger than this section's own example above.
README.md had no "Getting Started" section at all: no clone
instructions, no npm install, no Docker/Postgres setup, no DATABASE_URL
format, no run commands, and no test commands. A genuine newcomer could
not have gotten the app running from README.md alone at any point
through Lecture 13. Fixed by adding a full "Getting Started" section:
prerequisites, database setup (including the `docker start` vs
`docker run` distinction from Lecture 8), server setup, client setup,
and how to run all three test suites (including the separate
`inkwell_test` database from Lecture 13).
